# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Ph. D. in Economics and Ph. D. student in Applied Mathematics at Paris School of Economics - University of Paris 1. My research is focused in the study of restrictions and segmentation in the access to markets. Before, I obtained the Ph.D. in Economics in 2015 with a dissertation entitled "Trading Constraints and Incomplete markets: Information and Existence" where I was supervised by professor Juan Pablo Torres-Martínez. That is, I completed a 5-years training in economics with a degree in Commercial Engineering at the University of Chile. Then, I did a master's degree at the same place. My undergraduate and most of the post-graduate program was focused on statistical methods. Thus, I learnt micro econometrics and worked in empirical topics until I started my master's thesis.
